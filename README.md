# üêù Save The Bees ‚Äî Varroa Mites  #1 Enemy! (Dashboard)

## Overview

This Tableau dashboard explores the impact of **Varroa mite infestations** on honey bee colony losses across the United States.
Using data from the [`Save the Honey Bees` dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/m000sey/save-the-honey-bees/data), the analysis identifies Varroa mites as the **leading cause of colony decline**, compares their prevalence to other causes, and visualizes geographic and temporal trends.

## Key Insights

* **Varroa mites are the #1 reported cause** of colony loss, averaging the highest percentage among all reported causes.
* **Positive correlation** between Varroa mite % and colony loss %, supported by scatter plots and trend lines.
* Geographic heatmaps show that **Varroa infestation is widespread** across the U.S., not limited to a few states.
* Top-loss states (e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas) show **Varroa dominance** in cause breakdowns.
* Other causes (pesticides, diseases, weather) contribute to losses but have **weaker statistical relationships** with % Lost compared to Varroa.
